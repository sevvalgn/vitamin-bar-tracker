Vitamin Bar Tracker

A simple console-based Python application for tracking product sales, stock levels, and daily earnings in a small vitamin bar.

The project was created as a personal learning exercise to practice basic programming logic and real-life problem solving.

It uses only core Python features and focuses on clarity rather than complexity.
